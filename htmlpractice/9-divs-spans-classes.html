          <div class="enhance"> As an active contributor to the open-source developer and hacker culture, most prominently in areas involving the programming language Ruby,[12] he has written articles regarding his philosophies and opinions on various issues. He has been featured as a guest on podcasts, including Rubyology and SitePoint,[13] and he often speaks out about his conviction that developers should seek to collaborate more, and the measures which would promote such collaboration, such as writing better documentation and contributing to other people's projects.[14][non-primary source needed] Preston was one of the initial members of the San Francisco group IcanhazRuby or ICHR[when?], after he became a regular member of the San Francisco Ruby Meetups. He continued until the meetings became overwhelmed by venture capital investors searching for talent; this prompted him to seek more private gatherings.[12] On April 8, 2011, he also started a conference called CodeConf, by means of GitHub's influence in the coding community. Preston-Werner is the creator of the TOML configuration file format.[15] In an article published by Hacker Monthly

            in 2010, Preston wrote about his passion for ensuring that developers document the code they write so others can easily understand how it works.[16] In 2004, Preston-Werner founded Gravatar, a service for providing globally unique avatars that follow users from site to site. The company grew to about 32,000 users in 2007,[17][non-primary source needed] when Preston-Werner sold the company to Automattic.[18] In 2005 he moved to San Francisco to work at Powerset, a natural language search engine. Powerset was acquired by Microsoft. Preston-Werner declined a $300,000 bonus and stock options from Microsoft so that he could focus on GitH
